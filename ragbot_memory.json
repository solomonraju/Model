The result is the theoretical task capacity that minimizes idle time for the worker. f time it needs. for example, when the average round-trip time is 500 milliseconds, and the average task processing time is 1 second, then setting the task capacity to 2 minimizes the worker’s idle time between tasks. for example, when average task turnaround time is 2 seconds, of which communication time contributes only 10 milliseconds to the total, then task capacity is the same as the number of processors or threads. If the message producer has a delivery delay set, then the time returned here after calling the send method represents the earliest time when the EMS server will deliver the message to consumers.",
      "web": "Time is the continuous progression of existence that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, and into the future. Time dictates all forms of action, age, and causality, being a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.",

Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in Western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence. Commonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of reptilian, mammalian, and avian features.",
